# Physical-Computing-Face-Recognition

This repository allows you to run a simple image recognition program, which logs the number of images (up to 5) seen in the captured video.
You will need one Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera to run run this project.

To execute the code you only need to run the following command:
'''python livedetection.py'''

The code is based on the *RPiFaceRecognition* repository from Adam Gaynor.
